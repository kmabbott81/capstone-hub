# Capstone Hub - Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Capstone Hub - Secure AI-Integrated Project Management Platform
**Organization:** Harry L. Stearns, Inc.
**Academic Context:** MBA Capstone Project, University of Oregon
**Version:** v0.36.3
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Production-Ready

---

## Problem Statement

Harry L. Stearns, Inc., a construction consulting firm, faces operational inefficiencies due to fragmented project management workflows across multiple disconnected tools (spreadsheets, documents, email threads, and manual tracking systems). This fragmentation results in:

- **Information Silos**: Critical project data scattered across platforms, hindering decision-making
- **Manual Overhead**: Repetitive data entry and status updates consuming 15-20 hours weekly
- **Limited Visibility**: Lack of real-time project insights and progress tracking
- **Collaboration Barriers**: Difficulty coordinating deliverables across distributed teams
- **AI Integration Gap**: No structured framework to leverage AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Notion) for workflow automation

Traditional project management solutions (Asana, Monday.com, Jira) either lack AI integration capabilities or present privacy concerns for sensitive consulting data. The firm requires a **secure, privacy-first platform** that consolidates project workflows while enabling controlled AI augmentation.

---

## Solution Overview

Capstone Hub is a **production-grade, privacy-first project management platform** designed specifically for consulting firms navigating the AI transformation landscape. Built with Flask (Python), the platform provides:

### Core Capabilities
- **Unified Project Management**: Centralized tracking for deliverables, business processes, AI technologies, software tools, and research items
- **Role-Based Security**: Admin and Viewer roles with granular permissions (RBAC)
- **Privacy-by-Design**: Zero PII collection, data minimization, transparent retention policies
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Structured data model enabling future AI integration for insights and automation
- **Self-Auditing Infrastructure**: Continuous verification via CI/CD, telemetry, and automated testing

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask 3.0+ (Python), SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Security**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, session management, password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256)
- **Deployment**: Railway cloud hosting with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Multi-platform verification (Ubuntu + Windows), automated smoke tests
- **Monitoring**: Privacy-safe telemetry tracking health scores and operational metrics

## Demonstrated Lifecycle Proof

This capstone project showcases a **complete software development lifecycle** from concept through production deployment, demonstrating professional-grade engineering practices.

### Phase 1: Security Foundation (v0.36.0)
**Scope**: Establish enterprise-grade security baseline
**Delivered**:
- Authentication system with role-based access control
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- Rate limiting (5 attempts/15 minutes)
- Session management with 30-minute timeout
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Automated security audit via pip-audit

**Evidence**: Security audit documentation in `security/phase1_audit/`

---

### Phase 1b: Pre-Production Hardening (v0.36.1)
**Scope**: Production readiness and operational polish
**Delivered**:
- Password hashing with werkzeug.security (dual-mode: hash for production, plain for development)
- Log redaction (automatic filtering of passwords, tokens, keys)
- Rotating log files (10MB × 5 backups)
- Build verification scripts (`verify_build.sh`, `validate_env.py`)
- Security header verification (`verify_headers.py`)
- Comprehensive deployment documentation

**Evidence**: Hermetic proof artifacts in `security/build_snapshot/`
- `admin_guard_proof.txt` - Admin protection verification
- `rate_limit_proof.txt` - Rate limiting validation

---

### Phase 1c: Governance & Observability (v0.36.2)
**Scope**: Compliance documentation and operational monitoring
**Delivered**:

**Data Governance**:
- Complete privacy policy (PRIVACY.md) documenting no-PII collection
- Data retention policy (DATA_RETENTION.md) with 14-day to 5-year schedules
- Security policy updates with cross-references

**Telemetry Lite**:
- Privacy-safe operational observability (`telemetry_lite.py`)
- Health scoring (0-100 scale) based on database health, error rates, security events
- Weekly summary reports without IP tracking or PII
- Integration with `make smoke` for post-deployment validation

**Phase 2 Planning**:
- Feature expansion roadmap (`PHASE2_PLANNING.md`)
- 17+ proposed features across 7 categories (AI integration, dashboards, collaboration)
- Risk assessment and effort estimation (S/M/L/XL scale)
- Architectural boundaries protecting security foundation

**Evidence**: Governance policies at repository root + telemetry summaries in `logs/`

---

### Continuous Integration & Deployment
**Infrastructure**: Self-auditing platform with automated verification

**CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/preflight.yml`):
- Multi-platform testing matrix (Ubuntu + Windows, Python 3.10/3.11/3.12)
- Automated security scanning (pip-audit)
- Build verification (tests + manifest generation)
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Critical file presence validation

**Automation** (`Makefile`):
- `make smoke` - Complete verification suite (build + env + proofs + headers + telemetry)
- `make deploy` - One-command Railway deployment
- `make audit` - Security dependency scanning

**Results**: All CI/CD checks passing, health score 100/100

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Security-First Design Pays Dividends**: Implementing CSRF, rate limiting, and RBAC early prevented costly refactoring later
2. **Telemetry Without Tracking**: Privacy-safe monitoring (aggregate stats only) provides operational visibility without ethical concerns
3. **Documentation as Code**: Treating policies (SECURITY, PRIVACY) as version-controlled artifacts ensures consistency
4. **Hermetic Verification**: Capturing proof artifacts (admin_guard, rate_limit, headers) enables reproducible audits

### Process Discoveries
1. **Incremental Tagging Strategy**: Semantic versioning with descriptive suffixes (-sealed, -governance, -telemetry) improves clarity
2. **Cross-Platform CI/CD**: Testing on Windows + Ubuntu catches encoding issues (Unicode symbols) before production
3. **Make Targets**: Simple automation (`make smoke`) reduces cognitive load for complex verification sequences
4. **Change Control Early**: Documenting rollback procedures before incidents reduces MTTR (mean time to recovery)

### AI Collaboration Effectiveness
- **Claude Code Integration**: 100% of code and documentation generated via AI pair programming
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-turn conversations enabled comprehensive security hardening
- **Knowledge Transfer**: AI-generated documentation serves as both deliverable and learning artifact
- **Best Practices**: AI suggested industry-standard patterns (PBKDF2, CSP, CSRF) proactively
