## 📝 Claude Code Context Prompt for Future Sessions

```
I'm working on the Capstone Hub project for Kyle Mabbott's OEMBA Capstone 25-26.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Location: C:\Users\kylem\capstone-hub-complete-dev-package
- Live URL: https://mabbott-oemba-capstone-25-26-production.up.railway.app
- Original Manus URL (backup): https://77h9ikc6780p.manus.space/
- Platform: Railway (free tier)
- Stack: Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite + Vanilla JS
- Git: Initialized but not pushed to GitHub yet

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- src/main.py - Flask application entry point
- src/models/ - SQLAlchemy models (deliverable, research_item, ai_technology, business_process, software_tool, integration, user)
- src/routes/ - REST API endpoints for all models + auth + advanced_features
- src/static/ - Frontend (index.html, app.js, styles.css, auth-fixed.js)
- src/database/app.db - SQLite database (currently empty)
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies
- Procfile - Railway deployment config

WHAT'S WORKING:
- Application is live and functional on Railway
- All sections load correctly (Dashboard, Deliverables, Business Processes, AI Technologies, Research, Integrations)
- Local development environment set up and tested
- Database models and API endpoints are implemented
- Authentication system exists (client-side with admin password)

WHAT NEEDS WORK (per CURRENT_ISSUES.md):
- Content creation forms exist but may need testing/debugging
- File upload functionality not yet implemented
- Admin authentication may need backend validation
- Charts need real data population
- No GitHub repo created yet (git initialized locally only)

DEPLOYMENT INFO:
- Railway CLI authenticated
- Deploy command: railway up
- Check logs: railway logs
- Open dashboard: https://railway.com/project (then find "mabbott-oemba-capstone-25-26")

PREVIOUS SESSION SUMMARY:
We successfully migrated from Manus platform to Railway, extracted the complete dev package, tested locally, and deployed with a clean URL. Kyle wanted to move away from Manus due to subscription costs. The application is now fully under his control on Railway's free tier.

USER PREFERENCES:
- Keep things concise and direct
- Prefers command-line/automated solutions over manual GUI steps
- Wants full ownership and control of deployment
- Values clean, professional URLs and naming
```

## 🔨 What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Project Discovery & Extraction
**Time:** ~8:00 PM

- Located Manus-created capstone documentation website files
- Found compressed package: `Enhanced-Capstone-Hub-Complete-Dev-Package.tar.gz`
- Extracted to: `C:\Users\kylem\capstone-hub-complete-dev-package`
- Verified complete structure:
  - ✅ src/models/ (7 model files)
  - ✅ src/routes/ (8 route files)
  - ✅ src/static/ (8 frontend files)
  - ✅ src/database/app.db (empty SQLite database)
  - ✅ requirements.txt (11 Python packages)
  - ✅ Documentation files (AI_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md, CURRENT_ISSUES.md, etc.)

### 2. Local Development Setup
**Time:** ~8:10 PM

```bash
cd "C:\Users\kylem\capstone-hub-complete-dev-package"
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python main.py
```

**Result:** ✅ Flask server ran successfully on http://127.0.0.1:5000

### 3. Deployment Preparation
**Time:** ~8:15 PM

**Created deployment files:**
- `Procfile` with content: `web: cd src && python main.py`
- `.gitignore` excluding venv, __pycache__, *.db-journal, etc.

**Updated main.py:**
- Changed port from hardcoded 5000 to `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`
- Changed debug mode from `True` to `False` for production

### 4. Git Repository Initialization
**Time:** ~8:20 PM

```bash
cd "C:\Users\kylem\capstone-hub-complete-dev-package"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Capstone Hub application from Manus"
```

**Files committed:** 36 files, 5,804 lines

### 5. Railway Deployment (First Attempt)
**Time:** ~8:25 PM

**Issue:** Random project name generated: `tranquil-youthfulness`
**URL generated:** https://tranquil-youthfulness-production-820e.up.railway.app
**Status:** ✅ Deployed successfully but URL was not ideal

### 6. Railway Redeployment with Custom Name
**Time:** ~8:35 PM

```bash
railway unlink
railway init --name "mabbott-oemba-capstone-25-26"
railway up
railway domain
```

**Final URL:** https://mabbott-oemba-capstone-25-26-production.up.railway.app
**Status:** ✅ Deployed successfully with clean, professional URL

### 7. Verification & Testing
**Time:** ~8:40 PM

**Tested URL:** https://mabbott-oemba-capstone-25-26-production.up.railway.app

**Verified Working:**
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ All sections present (Deliverables, Business Processes, AI Technologies, Research, Integrations)
- ✅ Project Progress indicator (75%)
- ✅ Professional UI/UX
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🔐 Authentication Info

**Admin Password:** `HLStearns2025!` (client-side only, currently)

**Location:** `src/static/auth-fixed.js`

**Note:** This is currently client-side authentication. For production use, consider implementing proper backend authentication with hashed passwords and JWT tokens.

## 📋 Known Issues & TODO Items

From `CURRENT_ISSUES.md`:

### High Priority
1. **Content Creation Forms** - Modals exist but need testing
2. **API Integration Testing** - Verify all CRUD operations work
3. **File Upload** - Not yet implemented
4. **Backend Authentication** - Currently client-side only

### Medium Priority
1. **Real Chart Data** - Charts show placeholder data
2. **GitHub Repository** - Code not pushed to GitHub yet
3. **Error Handling** - Need better error messages and validation
4. **Loading States** - Add spinners for API calls

### Low Priority
1. **Export Functionality** - CSV/JSON export needs testing
2. **Collaboration Features** - Multi-user support
3. **Mobile Optimization** - Further responsive design improvements

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Manus Platform
- **Cost:** Exceeded comfort zone (subscription-based)
- **Control:** Limited
- **Reason for leaving:** Monthly costs too high

### Railway (New Platform)
- **Cost:** Free tier (current usage)
- **Limits:** 500 hours/month execution time, $5/month in credits
- **Control:** Full control
- **Benefits:**
  - Own the deployment
  - Can modify anytime
  - Simple CLI deployment
  - Automatic HTTPS
  - Good performance
