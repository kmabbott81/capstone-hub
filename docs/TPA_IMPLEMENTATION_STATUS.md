## 🚧 In Progress / Next Steps

### Test Suites to Complete

1. **E2E User Flows** (`tests/playwright/flows.spec.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for all 6 resource types
   - Navigation flows
   - Modal interactions
   - Filter/search functionality
   - Session management

2. **Security Tests** (`tests/playwright/security.spec.ts`)
   - CSRF positive/negative tests
   - Cookie flags verification
   - RBAC enforcement
   - Rate limiting verification
   - Header security checks

3. **Accessibility Tests** (`tests/playwright/accessibility.spec.ts`)
   - axe-core integration for all pages
   - Keyboard navigation tests
   - Focus management verification
   - ARIA label checks
   - Color contrast validation

4. **Headers Tests** (`tests/playwright/headers.spec.ts`)
   - CSP header validation
   - Security headers present
   - Cache control verification
   - Robots tag for API routes

### Scripts to Create

5. **Log Redaction Assertion** (`scripts/assert_logs_clean.py`)
   ```python
   # Scan logs/ for sensitive data
   # Regex: (password|token|api[-_ ]?key|secret)
   # Exit 1 on any match
   ```

6. **Telemetry Health Check** (`scripts/assert_telemetry_health.py`)
   ```python
   # Verify health score ≥ 95
   # Check event counters
   # Validate no silent failures
   ```

7. **Deployment Canary** (`scripts/canary.sh`)
   ```bash
   # curl /__version__
   # curl /_stcore/health
   # Basic API read test
   # Exit 0 = green, 1 = red (rollback)
   ```

### Infrastructure

8. **Lighthouse CI** (`.lighthouserc.json`)
   - Performance budgets
   - Accessibility thresholds
   - Best practices checks
   - SEO validation

9. **Makefile Targets**
   ```makefile
   tpa: Run full TPA suite
   tpa-ci: CI-safe variant
   tpa-approve-baseline: Update visual baselines
   tpa-visual: Visual regression only
   tpa-flows: E2E flows only
   tpa-security: Security tests only
   tpa-a11y: Accessibility only
   tpa-performance: Lighthouse only
   ```

10. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/tpa.yml`)
    - Parallel job execution
    - Artifact upload on failure
    - Quality gate enforcement
    - Automatic baseline approval (on-demand)

## Quality Gates (When Fully Implemented)

### Blocking (Fails PR/Merge)
- ❌ Visual regression >0.1% pixel diff
- ❌ Any E2E flow failure
- ❌ Critical/serious a11y violations
- ❌ Security test failures
- ❌ Lighthouse Performance < 90
- ❌ Lighthouse Accessibility < 95
- ❌ Log redaction failures
- ❌ Telemetry health < 95

### Non-Blocking (Warnings)
- ⚠️ Minor contrast on badges
- ⚠️ Small CLS on cards
- ⚠️ Lighthouse SEO < 90

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Foundation) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Infrastructure setup
- ✅ Playwright installation
- ✅ Visual regression starter
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Phase 2 (Core Tests) - Target: Week 2
- [ ] Complete all 5 test suites
- [ ] Create 3 assertion scripts
- [ ] Set up Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Add Makefile targets

### Phase 3 (CI Integration) - Target: Week 3
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Artifact management
- [ ] Badge integration

### Phase 4 (Optimization) - Target: Week 4
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Flaky test remediation
- [ ] Baseline optimization
- [ ] Historical tracking

| E2E Flows | 4 hours | High |
| Security Tests | 3 hours | High |
| A11y Tests | 2 hours | High |
| Headers Tests | 1 hour | Medium |
| Log Assertion | 1 hour | Medium |

## Success Metrics

When TPA is fully operational:

1. **Zero production regressions** in UI, security, or functionality
2. **<5 min CI feedback** on every PR
3. **100% test coverage** of critical user flows
4. **0 a11y violations** on all pages
5. **Lighthouse scores ≥ 90** maintained
6. **Automated canary** prevents bad deploys
