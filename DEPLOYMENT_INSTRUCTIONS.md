# Deployment Instructions

## Current Live Application
- **URL**: https://77h9ikc6780p.manus.space
- **Platform**: Manus deployment system
- **Status**: Active and functional

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (optional but recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. Extract the development package to your preferred directory
2. Navigate to the project directory in terminal
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Navigate to the src directory: `cd src`
7. Start the development server: `python main.py`
8. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### Development Workflow
The Flask application runs in debug mode by default, which means changes to Python files will automatically restart the server. Changes to static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) require a browser refresh to see updates.

## Alternative Deployment Platforms

### Heroku Deployment
Heroku provides a straightforward deployment option for Flask applications. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory with the content `web: python src/main.py`. Set the PORT environment variable in your Flask application to use `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`. Add a `runtime.txt` file specifying your Python version.

The application uses SQLite by default, which works for development but may not persist data across Heroku dyno restarts. Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL for production Heroku deployments by adding the Heroku Postgres add-on and updating the database configuration.

### Vercel Deployment
Vercel can host Flask applications using their Python runtime. Create a `vercel.json` configuration file specifying the Python runtime and the entry point. The static files will be served automatically, and the Flask routes will handle API requests.

### Railway Deployment
Railway offers simple Flask deployment with automatic builds from Git repositories. The platform automatically detects Flask applications and handles the deployment process. Database persistence is maintained across deployments.

### DigitalOcean App Platform
DigitalOcean's App Platform supports Flask applications with automatic scaling and managed databases. The platform can connect to GitHub repositories for continuous deployment and offers PostgreSQL database options.

## Database Configuration

### SQLite (Current)
The application currently uses SQLite for simplicity and portability. The database file (`app.db`) is created automatically in the src directory on first run. This configuration works well for development and single-user scenarios.

### PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
For production deployments with multiple users, PostgreSQL offers better performance and concurrent access handling. Update the database URL in the Flask configuration to use a PostgreSQL connection string. Most cloud platforms offer managed PostgreSQL services.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file for local development with database URLs and secret keys. Production deployments should use platform-specific environment variable configuration rather than committing sensitive information to version control.

## Security Considerations

### Secret Key Configuration
The Flask application uses a hardcoded secret key for session management. In production deployments, this should be replaced with a randomly generated secret key stored as an environment variable.

### HTTPS Configuration
Production deployments should enforce HTTPS connections to protect user authentication and data transmission. Most cloud platforms provide automatic SSL certificate management.

### Database Security
If using cloud database services, ensure proper access controls and encryption are configured. Avoid using default database credentials and implement regular backup procedures.

## Performance Optimization

### Static File Serving
The current configuration serves static files through Flask, which is suitable for development but not optimal for production. Consider using a CDN or reverse proxy like Nginx to serve static assets more efficiently.

### Database Query Optimization
As the application grows, monitor database query performance and add indexes where appropriate. The SQLAlchemy models can be optimized with relationship loading strategies and query optimization.

### Caching Implementation
For improved performance, consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data using Redis or similar caching solutions. This is particularly beneficial for dashboard analytics and reporting features.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Logging
Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring purposes. Use Python's logging module to capture application events, errors, and user activities. Configure log levels appropriately for development versus production environments.

### Error Tracking
Consider integrating error tracking services like Sentry to monitor application errors in production. This provides valuable insights into application stability and user experience issues.

### Performance Monitoring
Monitor application performance metrics including response times, database query performance, and resource utilization. This information helps identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
Implement regular database backup procedures to protect against data loss. Most cloud platforms offer automated backup services, but manual backup procedures should also be documented and tested.

### Code Version Control
Maintain the application code in a Git repository with proper branching strategies. This enables rollback capabilities and collaborative development workflows.

### Disaster Recovery Planning
Document recovery procedures for various failure scenarios including database corruption, server failures, and security incidents. Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure they work as expected.

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
The current application architecture supports horizontal scaling by deploying multiple application instances behind a load balancer. Ensure session data is stored in a shared location rather than in-memory for multi-instance deployments.

### Database Scaling
As data volume grows, consider database scaling strategies including read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization. Monitor database performance metrics to identify scaling needs.

### Content Delivery
For applications with significant file upload and download requirements, implement cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage with appropriate CDN configuration for global content delivery.
